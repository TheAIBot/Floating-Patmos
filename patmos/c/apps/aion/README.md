## Time synchronization applications for real-time Ethernet

### Experiments
* timestamp_compare.c : compares hardware timestamping against software timestamping
* tsn_timesyncdemo.c : implements the IEEE 1588 Precise Time Protocol. It can be configured to run either as PTP Master or Slave with run-time adjustable synchronization interval.
* tte_timesyncdemo.c : implements a TTEthernet synchronization client. Configuration is still work-in-progress.
